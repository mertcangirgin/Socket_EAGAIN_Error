# Socket_EAGAIN_Error
This code shows how to handle the EAGAIN error when reading data from a socket in Python, and how to turn off the socket without stopping the process.

if we receive an EAGAIN error while reading data from the socket, we first close the file descriptor associated with the socket without stopping the process. Then, we re-create the socket and try reading from it again. If we still receive an EAGAIN error, we print an error message and exit the program. If we receive an error other than EAGAIN, we re-raise the exception. Finally, we continue with the rest of the process.
